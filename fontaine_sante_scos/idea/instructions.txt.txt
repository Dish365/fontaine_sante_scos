This company wants me as the software engineer and sustainability accessment researcher to build a software that will help them. The solutiont they are looking for are:

Economic: They source from different countries and regions. find an optimize engine for sourcing from the most cost effective supplyers. Considering all factors that contribute economically to the cost of sourcing (product cost, transportation and shipping, taxes, tarrifs, all other logistics cost to get the product from the supplyer to the factory).


The second solution is:
Quality. Quality assessment engine for Accessing the quality of the product

the third solution is:
the environmental impact assessment engine. A research conducted to help with accessing this. but for now lets create a useful environmental impact assesment engine for this

 the fourth and final solution is a trade off analytics engine or a decition supporting system. This will help the company to:
1. make a trade off analysis between economics (from the economics engine results), environmental (from the environmental engine results) and quality (from the quality assessment engine results)
2. A decision supporting system that will allow the company to set some paramenters and the system will calculate and provide the most optimized results In terms of sourcing the raw materials factoring in the economics, environmental and quality. the can set some desired trade offs for (the economics, environmental and quality.)


The tech stack for the backend is a blend between Django (for handling user authentication and the models for the database) and FastApi to handle to calculations and the logics) with a service that will allow the communication between the Django and FastApi.
